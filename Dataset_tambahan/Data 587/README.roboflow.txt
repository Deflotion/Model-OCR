The dataset includes 1319 images.
Plate are annotated in Tensorflow Object Detection format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random rotation of between -8 and +8 degrees
* Random shear of between -5째 to +5째 horizontally and -6째 to +6째 vertically
* Random exposure adjustment of between -12 and +12 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 0.25 pixels
