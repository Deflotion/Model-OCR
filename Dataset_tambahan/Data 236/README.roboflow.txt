The dataset includes 572 images.
Alphanumeric are annotated in Tensorflow Object Detection format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 300x100 (Stretch)
* Grayscale (CRT phosphor)
* Auto-contrast via adaptive equalization

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random rotation of between -10 and +10 degrees
* Random shear of between -15째 to +15째 horizontally and -15째 to +15째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 2 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 3 percent of pixels
